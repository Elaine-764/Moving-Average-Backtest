# Moving Average Crossover Strategy: A Systematic Evaluation

**Research Question:** Can a simple moving average crossover strategy be made profitable through systematic refinement, or is the underlying concept fundamentally flawed?

**Answer:** No, not on highly efficient assets like SPY. Despite systematic refinements, the strategy consistently underperformed buy-and-hold across multiple market regimes.

## Key Findings

- **Baseline Strategy (MA 20/50):** 7.4542% annual return vs 11.0467% buy-and-hold (Sharpe: 0.41)
- **Three Refinements Tested:** ATR volatility filter, ADX regime detection, dynamic position sizing
- **Result:** All refinements failed to improve risk-adjusted returns
- **Root Cause:** Signal quality, not execution details - MA crossovers lack predictive power on liquid ETFs
- **Silver Lining:** Strategy provided downside protection during corrections (2018 Q4, 2022 bear market)

### Performance Summary

| V1: ATR Filter     | 5.69%         | 0.37            | -17.52%      | 33     | Worse           |
| V2: ADX Regime     | 6.09%         | 0.38            | -21.30%      | 30     | Worse           |
| V3: Dynamic Sizing | 6.71%         | 0.44            | -20.91%      | 36     | Best Refinement |
| **Buy & Hold SPY** | **10.8%**     | **0.68**        | **-33.8%**   | **0**  | **Best**        |

## Methodology Highlights

### Baseline Strategy
- **Entry:** Buy when 20-day MA crosses above 50-day MA
- **Exit:** Sell when 20-day MA crosses below 50-day MA
- **Position:** Fixed $10,000 per trade
- **Costs:** 0.15% per trade (commission + slippage)

### Refinements Tested
1. **V1: ATR Volatility Filter** - Avoid trading during top 30% most volatile periods
2. **V2: ADX Regime Detection** - Only trade when market is trending (ADX > 25)
3. **V3: Dynamic Position Sizing** - Scale position size inversely with volatility

### Robustness Testing
- **Train/Test Split:** 70/30 (2015-2021 train, 2022-2025 test)
- **Walk-Forward Analysis:** 6 expanding windows
- **Parameter Sensitivity:** Test MA periods ±20%, thresholds ±10%
- **Regime Analysis:** Test across 7 different market conditions
- **Monte Carlo:** 1000 bootstrap simulations

## Key Insights

### Why Refinements Failed

1. **Too Few Signals:** With only 25-36 trades over 7 years, filters either removed good trades or had insufficient statistical power
2. **Market Efficiency:** SPY is the most liquid, widely-followed asset globally - simple technical rules are arbitraged away
3. **Signal Quality Problem:** The issue isn't execution (costs, timing, sizing) but that MA crossovers lack predictive power
4. **Bull Market Dominance:** 2015-2021 was primarily bullish - strategies that keep you "out" hurt returns

### When It Works

Strategy shows value only during sharp corrections:
- **2018 Q4 Correction:** Avoided -45% drop
- **2022 Bear Market:** Lost -18% vs -19% for buy-and-hold

But chronic underperformance in bull markets (-5% annually) doesn't justify rare downside protection.

### What Would Be Required

For MA strategies to succeed:
1. **Less efficient assets** - Small-caps, emerging markets, crypto
2. **Multiple signals** - Ensemble approach combining fundamentals + technicals
3. **Machine learning** - Adaptive regime detection
4. **Different strategy** - Mean reversion may work where trend-following fails

## Value of Negative Results

Despite the strategy not beating buy-and-hold, this project demonstrates:

- Rigorous backtesting methodology with proper train/test splits  
- Understanding of overfitting risks  
- Comprehensive robustness testing across multiple dimensions  
- Transparency about strategy limitations  
- Clear documentation of the process
